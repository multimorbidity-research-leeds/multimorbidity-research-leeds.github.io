## Survivorship and Multimorbidity Epidemiology Group

Led by Dr Marlous Hall, the [Survivorship and Multimorbidity Epidemiology Research Group](https://lida.leeds.ac.uk/research-projects/survivorship-and-multimorbidity-epidemiology/) focusses on developing a deeper understanding of the long term survival trajectories for individuals with chronic disease. In particular, the groups' research focusses on the discovery of multi-disease clusters and disease accrual over the life course to drive forward our understanding of the role of concomitant disease and multimorbidity on long term outcomes. The group has a strong methodological foundation in advanced statistical modelling techniques and health data analytics, and use a range of national electronic health care records and clinical registry data to underpin its research.

The research group is based within the Leeds Institute for Data Analytics, and is part of the Clinical and Population Sciences Department in the Leeds Institute of Cardiovascular and Metabolic Medicine at the University of Leeds.
