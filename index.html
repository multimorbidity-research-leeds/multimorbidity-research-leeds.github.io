Led by Dr Marlous Hall, the Survivorship and Multimorbidity Epidemiology group focusses on developing a deeper understanding of the long term survival trajectories for individuals with chronic disease. In particular, the groups' research focusses on the discovery of multi-disease clusters and trajectories to drive forward our understanding of the role of concomitant disease and multimorbidity on individual survivorship trajectories. The group has a strong methodological foundation in advanced statistical techniques and health data analytics, and use a range of national electronic health care records and clinical registry data to underpin its research. The research group is based within the Leeds Institute for Data Analytics, and is part of the Clinical and Population Sciences Department in the Leeds Institute of Cardiovascular and Metabolic Medicine.

Dr Marlous Hall joined the University of Leeds as a medical statistician in 2009, building up expertise in applied healthcare research in cancer and cardiovascular disease. She was successfully awarded a Sir Henry Wellcome Fellowship and appointed as University Academic Fellow in Cardiovascular Survivorship and Multimorbidity in 2017. Dr Hall has extensive expertise in the processing and analyses of large scale and complex healthcare data, with a particular focus in the application of advanced methodologies including multistate modelling, multiple imputation, multilevel modelling, survival techniques such as flexible parametric survival modelling and relative survival. Following her work in both cancer and cardiovascular disease epidemiology, Dr Hall developed a particular interest in multi-disease research which relies on the efficient use of increasingly complex data and methodologies.
